The N2Mutan app is a hypothetical e-commerce web application that serves as a multi-vendor marketplace. It provides a platform where multiple vendors can showcase and sell their products to customers. Here's a description of the app's features and functionality based on the provided directory structure:

Frontend:

The frontend of the app is a static web application accessible from a browser.
It consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
The public directory contains the public assets, such as the index.html file, CSS stylesheets, and images.
The src directory contains the source code of the application.

Components:

The components directory contains reusable components used throughout the app.
It includes components such as Header, ProductList, ProductItem, Cart, and Footer.
These components are responsible for rendering the respective sections of the app, such as the header, product listings, individual product items, shopping cart, and footer.

Pages:

The pages directory contains the main pages of the app.
It includes pages such as Home, Products, Cart, and Checkout.
These pages represent different views of the app, including the home page, product listing page, shopping cart page, and checkout page.

Data:

The data directory contains the products.json file.
This file serves as a data source for the products displayed in the app.
It contains information about the available products, such as their names, descriptions, prices, and images.

Utils:

The utils directory contains the api.js file.
This file provides utility functions for interacting with APIs or performing other data-related tasks.
It may include functions for fetching product data, handling API requests, or performing other data operations.

App.js and index.js:

The App.js file is the main entry point of the app.
It sets up the routing and renders the different pages based on the current URL.
The index.js file is responsible for rendering the App component and mounting it to the DOM.

Amplify Configuration:

The amplify.yml file contains the configuration for AWS Amplify deployment.
It specifies the build and deployment phases, as well as the artifacts to include in the deployment package.

AWS Exports:

The aws-exports.js file contains the configuration for the AWS services used in the app, such as AWS Cognito, AWS AppSync, and AWS S3.
It includes the AWS region, Cognito user pool and identity pool IDs, AppSync GraphQL endpoint, S3 bucket details, and other relevant configuration.
Overall, the N2Mutan app allows multiple vendors to showcase their products on a static web application. Customers can browse the product listings, add items to their shopping cart, and proceed to the checkout process. It leverages AWS Amplify for deployment and may integrate other AWS services for authentication, data storage, and API functionality.
